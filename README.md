## How to compile
### Config
Edit 'config.h' file before, to configure display type uncommenting the proper line:
```C++
// Descomentar solo uno de los displays utilizados.
//#define DISPLAY_TYPE_SDD1306_128X64     // Para usar pantalla OLED 0.96" I2C 128x64 pixels
#define DISPLAY_TYPE_SDD1306_128X64_lcdgfx // Para usar pantalla OLED 0.96" I2C 128x64 pixels (lcdgfx library)
//#define DISPLAY_TYPE_SH1106_128X64         // Define para usar pantalla OLED 1.30" I2C 128x64 pixels (SH1106)
//#define DISPLAY_TYPE_LCD_16X2             // Para usar LCD 16 x 2 carateres.
//#define DISPLAY_TYPE_LCD_16X2_I2C       // Para usar LCD 16 x 2 carateres. I2C.
```
Modify Arduino pin where you connect the LCD 16x2 char:
```C++
// Definiciones para display LCD 16x2 caracteres.
#define RS 2
#define ENABLE 3
#define D0 4
#define D1 5
#define D2 6
#define D3 7
```
Modify I2C port for LCD 16x2 I2C: (connect in SCL and SDA pins)
```C++
// Define direccion I2C para LCD16x2 char.
#define I2C 0x27
```
Comment the line below for define Timezone in sketch, uncomment for configure with 'Time.cfg' file.
```C++
// Define para establecer localtime en tiempo de ejecución o de compilación.
#define TIMEZONE_FILE   // Comentar para establecer TimeZone (localtime) en tiempo de ejecución (Time.cfg)
```
### Coding TimeChangeRules
Normally these will be coded in pairs for a given time zone: One rule to describe when daylight (summer) time starts, and one to describe when standard time starts.

New feature is implemented to configure Timezone. It can be defined in the sketch or by a config file saved on SD card (Time.cfg).

#### Set the Time Zone in the sketch

To define time zone on the sketch define a **TimeChangeRule** as follows, normally will need a pair of this:

`TimeChangeRule myRule = {abbrev, week, dow, month, hour, offset};`

Where:

  * **abbrev** is a character string abbreviation for the time zone; it must be no longer than five characters.
  * **week** is the week of the month that the rule starts.
  * **dow** is the day of the week that the rule starts.
  * **hour** is the hour in local time that the rule starts (0-23).
  * **offset** is the UTC offset in minutes for the time zone being defined.

For convenience, the following symbolic names can be used:

**week:** First, Second, Third, Fourth, Last
**dow:** Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat
**month:** Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec

For the Eastern US time zone, the TimeChangeRules could be defined as follows:

```C++
TimeChangeRule usEDT = {"EDT", Second, Sun, Mar, 2, -240};  //UTC - 4 hours
TimeChangeRule usEST = {"EST", First, Sun, Nov, 2, -300};   //UTC - 5 hours
```
For Central European time zone (Frankfurt, Paris), TimeChangeRules could be as:
```C++
TimeChangeRule CEST = {"CEST", Last, Sun, Mar, 2, 120};     // Central European Summer Time
TimeChangeRule CET = {"CET ", Last, Sun, Oct, 3, 60};       // Central European Standard Time
```

For more information see Timezone info at: https://github.com/JChristensen/Timezone#readme

Change lines like above in `TinyTrackGPS.cpp` file, at line **111**, with appropriate definition for your time zone.

<img alt="Log File." src="images/Timezone CE - code.png" width="760">&nbsp;

If your time zone is Australia, you can use this lines:

<img alt="Log File." src="images/Timezone ausET - code.png" width="760">&nbsp;

There are some info for time zone:
```C++
// Australia Eastern Time Zone (Sydney, Melbourne)
TimeChangeRule aEDT = {"AEDT", First, Sun, Oct, 2, 660};    // UTC + 11 hours
TimeChangeRule aEST = {"AEST", First, Sun, Apr, 3, 600};    // UTC + 10 hours
Timezone ausET(aEDT, aEST);

// Moscow Standard Time (MSK, does not observe DST)
TimeChangeRule msk = {"MSK", Last, Sun, Mar, 1, 180};
Timezone tzMSK(msk);

// Central European Time (Frankfurt, Paris)
TimeChangeRule CEST = {"CEST", Last, Sun, Mar, 2, 120};     // Central European Summer Time
TimeChangeRule CET = {"CET ", Last, Sun, Oct, 3, 60};       // Central European Standard Time
Timezone CE(CEST, CET);

// United Kingdom (London, Belfast)
TimeChangeRule BST = {"BST", Last, Sun, Mar, 1, 60};        // British Summer Time
TimeChangeRule GMT = {"GMT", Last, Sun, Oct, 2, 0};         // Standard Time
Timezone UK(BST, GMT);

// UTC
TimeChangeRule utcRule = {"UTC", Last, Sun, Mar, 1, 0};     // UTC
Timezone UTC(utcRule);

// US Eastern Time Zone (New York, Detroit)
TimeChangeRule usEDT = {"EDT", Second, Sun, Mar, 2, -240};  // Eastern Daylight Time = UTC - 4 hours
TimeChangeRule usEST = {"EST", First, Sun, Nov, 2, -300};   // Eastern Standard Time = UTC - 5 hours
Timezone usET(usEDT, usEST);

// US Central Time Zone (Chicago, Houston)
TimeChangeRule usCDT = {"CDT", Second, Sun, Mar, 2, -300};
TimeChangeRule usCST = {"CST", First, Sun, Nov, 2, -360};
Timezone usCT(usCDT, usCST);

// US Mountain Time Zone (Denver, Salt Lake City)
TimeChangeRule usMDT = {"MDT", Second, Sun, Mar, 2, -360};
TimeChangeRule usMST = {"MST", First, Sun, Nov, 2, -420};
Timezone usMT(usMDT, usMST);

// Arizona is US Mountain Time Zone but does not use DST
Timezone usAZ(usMST);

// US Pacific Time Zone (Las Vegas, Los Angeles)
TimeChangeRule usPDT = {"PDT", Second, Sun, Mar, 2, -420};
TimeChangeRule usPST = {"PST", First, Sun, Nov, 2, -480};
Timezone usPT(usPDT, usPST);
```

Timezone uses Time library so time is based on the standard Unix time_t.
The value is the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970. And store in unsigned long variable. Arduino
Reference describe unsigned long as : ```Unsigned long variables are extended size variables for number storage, and store 32 bits (4 bytes). Unlike standard longs unsigned longs won’t store negative numbers, making their range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1).``` It is predict to not be afected with 2038 effect. For more information see [Unix Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) at Wikipedia, and [Year 2038 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem). Assuming that timestamp is 4,294,967,295 (maximal value of unsigned long in Arduino, 2^32 - 1), it wil be in: **GMT: Sunday, 7 February 2106 6:28:15** when time_t overflow. Then time_t reset to 0 and date will be **GMT: Thursday, 1 January 1970 0:00:00**. Visit https://www.epochconverter.com/, an utility for Epoch & Unix Timestamp Conversion.

#### Set the Time Zone in the 'Time.cfg' file

Time Zone can be established by reading settings from a configuration file on an SD card. Use the same rules that is explained above for `TimeChangeRule`. If file 'Time.cfg' isn`t place on SD card or Card not inserted, UTC time will take for default. **Card must be placed on power on to config Time Zone.**

First section is rule for Summer Time of your region (UST), second one, it is for Standard Time. (UT)

Example file 'Time.cfg' for Central European Time (Frankfurt, Paris)
**File format: ```<name>=<value>```** 
```conf
# UST conf.
USTw=0
USTd=1
USTm=3
USTh=2
USTo=120

# UT conf.
UTw=0
UTd=1
UTm=10
UTh=3
UTo=60
```

Change the values with appropiate set of **w**.-'week', **d**.-'dow', **m**.-'month', **h**.-'hour' and **o**.-'offset'. Don`t change the names.

  * **week** - 0-Last, 1-First, 2-Second, 3-Third, 4-Fourth
  * **dow** - 1-Sun, 2-Mon, 3-Tue, 4-Wed, 5-Thu, 6-Fri, 7-Sat
  * **month** - 1-Jan, 2-Feb, 3-Mar, 4-Apr, 5-May, 6-Jun, 7-Jul, 8-Aug, 9-Sep, 10-Oct, 11-Nov, 12-Dec
  * **hour** - 0 - 23 hours.
  * **offset** - 0 - (+/-)720 minutes.

  It is used some correlation with constants defined for TimeChangeRules in `Timezone.h`:
```C++
// convenient constants for TimeChangeRules
enum week_t {Last, First, Second, Third, Fourth}; 
enum dow_t {Sun=1, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat};
enum month_t {Jan=1, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec};
```

## Working

It works getting info from NMEA module every second and save it into de log file. 


Log file Format is:
```
HH:MM:SS,YY.YYYYYY,XX.XXXXXX,ALT,UTM (WGS86)
```
Like this:
```
12:42:47,37.990493,-4.785790,571,30S 343186 4206265
12:42:48,37.990276,-4.785741,571,30S 343190 4206240
12:42:49,37.990062,-4.785705,571,30S 343193 4206216
12:42:50,37.989860,-4.785694,571,30S 343193 4206194
...
```
Where:
  * HH - Hours from GPS UTC.
  * MM - Minutes.
  * SS - Seconds.
  * YY.YYYYYY - Degree of latitude.
  * XX.XXXXXX - Degree of longitude.
  * ALT - Altitude in meters.
  * UTM - Coordenates in UTM format(WGS84): Zone Band X Y (00A XXXXXX YYYYYYY)

<img alt="Log File." src="images/image2.png" width="480">&nbsp;

For conversion to UTM coordinates use UTMConversion library. (https://github.com/RafaelReyesCarmona/UTMConversion)

Example of use:

```C++
#include "UTMconversion.h"

float flat = 37.8959210;
float flon = -4.7478210;

GPS_UTM utm;

void setup() {
  char utmstr[] = "30S 123456 1234567";

  Serial.begin(9600);  

  utm.UTM(flat, flon);
  sprintf(utmstr, "%02d%c %ld %ld", utm.zone(), utm.band(), utm.X(), utm.Y());
  Serial.println(utmstr);
}

void loop() {

}
```

File is named as:

`YYYYMMDD.csv` Example: `20210216.csv`

Where:
  * YYYY - Year 4 digits format.
  * MM - Mouth.
  * DD - Day.

### NMEA Secuence from GPS Module.

I am using a Ublox NEO-6MV2 module for get possition and time from GPS System. When GPS signal is ok, the module send the above information through serial:
```
$GPRMC,091620.00,A,3753.16481,N,00447.76212,W,9.209,273.97,201021,,,A*75
$GPVTG,273.97,T,,M,9.209,N,17.064,K,A*03
$GPGGA,091620.00,3753.16481,N,00447.76212,W,1,03,5.72,511.8,M,47.7,M,,*47
$GPGSA,A,2,21,31,22,,,,,,,,,,5.81,5.72,1.00*0F
$GPGSV,2,1,06,01,51,098,32,03,64,025,28,06,14,305,,21,33,114,40*73
$GPGSV,2,2,06,22,46,053,21,31,09,057,37*75
$GPGLL,3753.16481,N,00447.76212,W,091620.00,A,A*78
```

This [page](https://www.electroschematics.com/neo-6m-gps-module/) have all about NEO-6v2 and v3 modules information. 

It is very important how to program for get GPS information correctly. (Fixed since V0.10)

### Low Energy Comsuption
`Low-Power` - the library is used to reduce power consumption and gain greater autonomy implementing the project portably using lithium batteries. Use only when no display configuration.
Implemented in v0.4 first time and from v0.7. 

## TinyGPS library

### Versions prior V0.10

TinyGPS library works getting information from GPRMC and GPGGA sentences. It extract time, date, latitude, longitude, speed and course information from GPRMC sentence. And altitude, time, latitude, longitude, numbers of satellites in use and hdop information from GPGGA sentence.

The function ```bool TinyGPS::encode(char c)``` call to ```bool TinyGPS::term_complete()``` and return `true` when GPRMC or GPGGA sentence is decoded correctly. The above code on TinyTrackGPS:

<img alt="Log File." src="images/code_GPS_setup.png" width="760">&nbsp;

It is in ```setup()``` section. This code wait until GPRMC sentence is correctly recieved. Then config time and date whith the code: 

```C++
  utctime = makeTime(time_gps);
  localtime = TimeZone.toLocal(utctime);
```

Usually NEO6 module is config to 9600 bauds and with 1 Hz for transmit information. So, rest of sentences are ignored in ```setup()```.

In ```loop()``` the while loop get the first sentence from NEO6 module, it is GPRMC sentence.

<img alt="Log File." src="images/code_GPS_loop1.png" width="760">&nbsp;

To get altitude information is needed to decode GPGAA sentence, so call ```GPSRefresh()``` to do that.

<img alt="Log File." src="images/code_GPS_loop2.png" width="760">&nbsp;

### Fixed TinyGPS on V0.10

Now the function ```bool TinyGPS::encode(char c)``` call to ```bool TinyGPS::term_complete()``` and return `true` when GPRMC _and_ GPGGA sentence is decoded correctly. So all information is decoded at same time. Now ```GPSRefresh()``` is no neccessary.

Original code TinyGPS:
<img alt="TinyGPS" src="images/code_TinyGPS.png" width="760">&nbsp;

Fixed code TinyGPS (change return and break at the end):
<img alt="TinyGPS fix" src="images/code_TinyGPS_fixed.png" width="760">&nbsp;

### Fixed TinyGPS on V0.11

In TinyTrackGPS V0.11, TinyGPS library is a modified version from https://github.com/fmgomes/TinyGPS to adds support for newer NMEA-capable GPS devices that implement the [v3.x GNSS spec](http://geostar-navi.com/files/docs/geos3/geos_nmea_protocol_v3_0_eng.pdf) as well as devices that support [GLONASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS). This version is fixed to add support to GNGGA sentence and decode G_RMC _and_ G_GGA sentences at same time.

Fixed version is placed in 'lib/TinyGPS_GLONASS_fixed'. 
<img alt="TinyGPS Glonass Fix" src="images/code_TinyGPS_GLONASS_fixed.png" width="760">&nbsp;

### Fixed TinyGPS on V0.12

In TinyTrackGPS V0.12, TinyGPS library is modificated to saved flash memory and make run faster. The are sentences as GSA and GSV that there are no decodified, so 'encode()' function run faster.

This are the modifications on 'term_complete()' function:

## SdFat Library

 SdFat library provides an SPI interface to connect an SD card module with any microcontroller which supports this communication interface. MicroSD module use SPI communication interface to connect with microcontrollers. Using a micro SD card becomes very handy for applications where we need to store files or any data as this project.

 We will be able to read and write data to and from SD cards through the SPI communication protocol with the help of this library. There are different types of microSD card modules available in the market, but the most common pinout configuration has 6 terminals consisting of SPI and power supply terminals:

|**Pin Name**	| **Description**|
|:-------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|GND	    |This is the ground pin which should be connected with the ground pin of Arduino.|
|VCC	    |This pin supplies power to the module. The power supply of ~4.5V-5.5V. The adapter consists of a 3.3V voltage regulator circuit as well. It is connected with 5V pin of Arduino.|
|CS	      |This is the Chip Select pin for SPI communication.|
|MOSI	    |This is called the ‘Master Out Slave In.’ It is used as the SPI input to the module.|
|SCK	    |This is called the ‘Serial Clock’ pin which is used in SPI serial clock output.|
|MISO	    |This is called the ‘Master in Slave Out.’ It is used as the SPI output from the module.|

This page has more information about [Micro SD Card Interfacing with Arduino.](https://microcontrollerslab.com/micro-sd-card-interfacing-arduino-microsd-module/)

SdFat library, Bill Greiman, used externat SPI driver config 'SdFatConfig.h' as:

<img alt="SdFat fixed." src="images/code_SdFat_fix.png" width="760">&nbsp;

I used SoftwareSPI driver as you can see in the example code 'SoftwareSPI.ino':

<img alt="SoftwareSPI example." src="images/code_SoftwareSPI.png" width="760">&nbsp;

When SD card is extracted it is generated an error that can be read with ```card.sdErrorCode()``` function.
Before write to card it is verified that no error code is return.

## EMA filter and VCC library

The EMA (exponential moving average) or EWMA (exponentially weighed moving average) is the name for what is probably the easiest realization of the (first-order) low-pass on discrete time-domain data. 
```C++
Y[n] = alpha * X[n] + (1 - alpha) * Y[n-1]
```
A moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. When VCC library get the value, it can get small fluctuations in the measure. 

The code below use an EMA filter (alpha = 0.80), and it is adapted to calculate the numbers of rows to draw the battery level from 0 to 25. When battery is full charge and USB connector is plugged, level is set to 26.

<img alt="EMA filter and VCC measure." src="images/code_EMA and VCC.png" width="760">&nbsp;

|**Volts**|**Charge**|**Charge %**|
|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|4,25	    |25        |  100%      |
|4,20     |24        |  95%       |
|4,15	    |23        |  90%       |
|4,10	    |22        |  86%       |
|4,05	    |21        |  81%       |
|4,00	    |19        |  76%       |
|3,95	    |18        |  71%       |
|3,90	    |17        |  67%       |
|3,85	    |16        |  62%       |
|3,80	    |15        |  57%       |
|3,75	    |13        |  52%       |
|3,70	    |12        |  48%       |
|3,65	    |11        |  43%       |
|3,60	    |10        |  38%       |
|3,55	    |9         |  33%       |
|3,50	    |7	       |  29%       |
|3,45	    |6         |  24%       |
|3,40	    |5         |  19%       |
|3,35	    |4	       |  14%       |
|3,30	    |3	       |  10%       |
|3,25	    |1	       |  5%        |
|3,20	    |0	       |  0%        |

But, AVR must make lot of float point calcs. And I had an overflow and inesperate reset, with lost of information in CSV file and SD card incoherent data. So I have modify VCC library to use EMA implementation of Peter P (tttapa)(https://github.com/tttapa/tttapa.github.io/blob/master/Pages-src/Raw-HTML/Mathematics/Systems-and-Control-Theory/Digital-filters/Exponential%20Moving%20Average/resources/EMA-Arduino.ino)

<img alt="EMA Arduino implementation." src="images/code_EMA and VCC_2.png" width="760">&nbsp;

TinyTrackGPS show this information on display:

<img alt="TinyTrackGPS display data." src="images/IMG_20211221_124521.jpg" width="240">&nbsp;


When VCC level is 3,25 V, stop to read GPS data and only display battery level.
